Nubya Nyasha Garcia is an English jazz musician, saxophonist, composer and bandleader. In 2017, she released her debut EP Nubya's 5ive and peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart. It earned her nominations for Album of the Year, Best New Artist and Best British Female Solo Artist at the 2021 Brit Awards.
Nubya was born in 1991 in Camden Town, London to a Guyanese mother and a British Trinidadian father. She followed her three older siblings to the local Saturday music center at the age of 5, where she first learned the violin and later played the viola. 
Her home life with her stepdad, a brass player with a vast collection of instruments, and her mother a keen collector of all genres of music from reggae and Latin to classical and soul, meant she was saturated with music of all genres.
In her EP “When We Are”, Nubya explored how electronics can be used in a live jazz environment. She is also a member of the collective Nérija and the Afro-jazz ensemble Maisha.  She has described her album “Source” as a story “about my heritage, my ancestry, exploring those places and those stories from my parents and my grandparents.”
Nubya tours internationally, in Europe, India, Australia, and North America and also has a burgeoning reputation as a DJ.
She overcame her natural shyness by making herself go to as many jams as possible.
