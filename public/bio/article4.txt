Since her emergence as a teenager, west London singer-songwriter and poet Arlo Parks’s work has had plenty of acclaim. Rightly so: her music offers cerebral, softly candid musings, swimming with a gentle poeticism.
After taking home the breakthrough artist award, Arlo Parks took the stage at the 2021 Brit Awards to perform “Hope,” the lovely cut from her lauded debut album, Collapsed in Sunbeams.
Surrounded by sunflowers onstage, Parks performed “Hope” as lights flickered behind her, reflecting the luminosity of the Collapsed in Sunbeams highlights. “You’re not alone,” Parks chanted as the camera swiveled in front of her, the singer-songwriter growing in confidence over the course of the performance and eventually welcoming a brass section to put an exclamation point on the showcase.
The 20-year-old’s critically acclaimed Collapsed in Sunbeams peaked at No. 3 on the UK Albums chart following its January release. The full-length is nominated for British album of the year.
