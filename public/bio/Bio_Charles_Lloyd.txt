In 1956, Lloyd left Memphis for Los Angeles to earn a degree in music at the University of Southern California, where he studied with Bartók specialist Halsey Stevens. At night, he played in jazz clubs with Ornette Coleman, Billy Higgins, Scott LaFaro, Don Cherry, Charlie Haden and other leading west coast jazz artists. He also was a member of Gerald Wilson's big band.
Lloyd was presented with an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the Berklee College of Music.
In 2016, Lloyd was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame.
