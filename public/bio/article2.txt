Nubya Garcia has teamed up with globally acclaimed producers and remixers like Makaya McCraven, DJ Tahira, and more to celebrate Record Store Day 2021. On June 12, Concord Jazz and the London-based saxophone player will release SOURCE ≡ OUR DANCE, a remix 12” EP presented on turquoise blue with black colored vinyl.
This Record Store Day exclusive is a collection of four remix tracks from Nubya’s celebrated debut album SOURCE, reimagined through collaboration with cutting edge artists like the aforementioned producers in addition to Mark de Clive-Lowe and Shy One. This limited-edition EP comes hot on the heels of SOURCE, which landed on numerous Best Albums of 2020 lists, including MOJO, NPR, Paste, Pitchfork, and Rolling Stone, and one The New York Times describes as “a life’s worth of experiences into an hourlong listen.”
SOURCE delivered on the buzz surrounding Garcia’s two highly-acclaimed EPs: 2017’s Nubya’s 5ive, and 2018’s When We Are, the title track of which was named one of NPR’s Best Songs Of 2018. Garcia can also be heard on five of the nine tracks on We Out Here, the landmark compilation celebrating London’s thriving jazz scene.
Born and raised in North London, Nubya Garcia began playing saxophone at the age of 10. She studied under pianist Nikki Yeoh at Camden Music, before joining Gary Crosby’s Tomorrow’s Warriors in her late teens, and completing her training at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music.
In 2018, Garcia won the Jazz FM Breakthrough Act of the Year Award and the Sky Arts Breakthrough Act of the Year Award. A year later, she received Jazz FM UK Jazz Act of the Year Award. When she’s not on the road, Garcia can be heard on NTS Radio, where she hosts one of the station’s top radio shows.
