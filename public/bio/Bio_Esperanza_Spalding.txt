Esperanza Emily Spalding is an American jazz bassist, singer, songwriter, and composer. she has been described as “the 21st Century's Jazz Genius”. She has undeniably made her mark within that male-dominated, musically conservative field. At the same time, she's also shown her capacity to operate irrespective of its borders, an unusual achievement irrespective of her gender. 
A native of Portland, Esperanza played classical violin as a child and gigged in an indie band on bass as a teenager. She graduated from the Berklee College of Music in only three years, becoming, at the time, the youngest instructor in the school's history at the age of 20. 
By the time of her Grammy nomination, she'd already recorded three albums: “Junjo”, “Esperanza” and “Chamber Music Society”. Drummer, composer and producer Terri Lyne Carrington, who first met Spalding during those early Berklee years, prefers a different term: "I call her a genius every chance I get."
Similarly, few have traversed such diverse stylistic terrain at such a young age, a feat Esperanza has accomplished. She doesn't sing torch songs, rarely writes of romance as she doesn't attempt to reel in her audiences with flirtation. She chooses not to perform desire or longing, themes that fuel the most deeply held stereotypes of jazz women as singers who simply emote rather than perform with technical skill.
A favorite of the Obamas, Esperanza performed "Overjoyed" at the White House in tribute to Stevie Wonder in 2009.
Esperanza’s accolades include four Grammy Awards, a Boston Music Award, and a Soul Train Music Award.
